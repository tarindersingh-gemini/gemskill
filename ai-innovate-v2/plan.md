## Plan: Define AI Innovate Hackathon Artifacts

Create comprehensive templates, instructions, and evaluation criteria for all hackathon stages to enable automated validation via GitHub Copilot agents and structured human review by mentors and judges across the 6-week event.

### Steps

1. **Design Stage 2 participant materials** — Create idea submission template with sections for team info, problem statement, AI solution approach, resource requirements, and planned deliverables; develop GitHub Copilot validation instructions to check format compliance, completeness, duplication detection, and clarity thresholds

2. **Define Stage 3 reviewer materials** — Create proposal evaluation criteria covering innovation, feasibility, business value, and resource reasonableness; write Level 1 Copilot review instructions for automated filtering; and Level 2 manual review guide for mentor selection of promising proposals

3. **Establish Stage 5 midway check-in materials** — Create midway deliverable template and evaluation criteria focusing on progress velocity, technical approach, risk management, and resource utilization for mentor feedback

4. **Develop Stage 6 participant and reviewer materials** — Create final submission template with sections for working prototype, documentation, and demo materials; write three-level evaluation artifacts: Copilot validation instructions, Level 1 Copilot scoring, Level 2 mentor criteria for shortlisting top 10, and Level 3 judges panel rubric for final winner selection

### important Considerations

1. **Scoring methodology** — Evaluation use nweighted criteria percentages`

2. **GitHub Copilot instructions format** — Create `.md` files for human reference, at `.github/agents/<agent_name>.md` format
