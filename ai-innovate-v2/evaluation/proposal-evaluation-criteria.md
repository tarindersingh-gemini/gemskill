## Decision Thresholds

### Automated Level 1 Filtering
**Purpose:** Filter out proposals that clearly don't meet minimum standards

**Auto-Reject if:**
- Total automated score < 30 points (Innovation + Feasibility + Business Value + Resource + Clarity)
- Any single criterion scores 0-4 points
- Critical red flags (see Copilot agent instructions)

**Forward to Manual Review if:**
- Total automated score ≥ 30 points
- No criterion scores below 5 points
- No critical red flags

### Manual Level 2 Selection
**Purpose:** Select the most promising proposals for approval

**Approval Threshold:**
- Total score (including Team Capability) ≥ 60 points
- No criterion scores below 6 points (except Clarity which is automated)
- At least one criterion scores 17+ points (strength area)

**Selection Process:**
1. Score each proposal using the full rubric
2. Rank proposals by total score
3. Consider team diversity and problem domain coverage
4. Select proposals until resource capacity is reached
5. Provide feedback to all teams (approved and declined)

---

## Mentor Guidance

### Evaluation Best Practices

**1. Read Holistically First**
- Read the entire proposal before scoring
- Get a general sense of the idea and team
- Note initial impressions and concerns

**2. Score Each Criterion Independently**
- Evaluate each criterion against its specific rubric
- Don't let one strong/weak area bias others
- Be objective and consistent across proposals

**3. Consider Context**
- Participant experience level
- Problem domain complexity
- Available resources and time constraints

**4. Be Fair and Constructive**
- Look for potential, not just polish
- Consider how mentoring could strengthen weak areas
- Balance innovation vs. execution capability

**5. Document Rationale**
- Write brief notes explaining scores
- Identify specific strengths and concerns
- Provide actionable feedback

### Common Evaluation Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Over-valuing novelty** - Innovation is important, but not at the expense of feasibility
❌ **Under-valuing impact** - Unsexy but high-impact solutions deserve consideration
❌ **Perfection bias** - Proposals don't need to be perfect, just viable
❌ **Complexity bias** - Simple, well-executed ideas can be better than complex ambitious ones
❌ **Familiarity bias** - Don't favor ideas in your domain of expertise
❌ **Team reputation bias** - Evaluate the proposal, not who submitted it

### Calibration Exercise

Before evaluating submissions, mentors should:
1. Review sample proposals together
2. Score them independently
3. Compare scores and discuss differences
4. Align on interpretation of rubrics
5. Establish consistent standards

---

## Approval Capacity Planning

### Resource Considerations
- Mentor availability for guidance during development (Week 4-6)
- Technical resource availability (APIs, computing, tools)
- Maximum number of teams that can be effectively supported

### Recommended Approval Rates
- Target: Approve 40-60% of valid submissions
- For 27-55 expected teams: Aim to approve 15-30 teams
- Balance: Innovation/risk vs. feasibility/success rate

### Waitlist Strategy
- Create ranked waitlist for borderline proposals (scores 55-59)
- If approved teams drop out, invite waitlist teams
- Provide feedback to waitlist teams on what would strengthen their proposal
