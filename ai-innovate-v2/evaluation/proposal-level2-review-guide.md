# Stage 3 Level 2: Mentor Manual Review Guide

## Purpose
This guide helps mentors conduct thorough, consistent, and fair manual reviews of proposals that have passed Level 1 automated filtering. Mentors will evaluate Team Capability, validate automated scores, and make final approval decisions.

---

## Mentor Responsibilities

### Your Role
As a mentor reviewer, you are responsible for:
- **Completing the evaluation** that automation cannot do (Team Capability assessment)
- **Validating automated scores** and adjusting if the algorithm missed important context
- **Making final approval decisions** based on total scores and holistic assessment
- **Providing constructive feedback** to all teams, approved or declined
- **Capacity planning** to ensure approved teams can be properly supported
- **Maintaining fairness** and consistency across all reviews

### Time Commitment
- **Per proposal:** 15-20 minutes for thorough review
- **Expected volume:** 15-30 proposals (total 5-10 hours)
- **Deadline:** Complete reviews within 3 business days

---

## Review Process

### Step 1: Preparation (Before Reviewing)

**1.1 Calibration Exercise**
- Review 2-3 sample proposals with co-mentor
- Score independently then compare
- Discuss any significant scoring differences
- Align on interpretation of rubrics
- Establish consistent standards

**1.2 Understand Context**
- Review total number of submissions
- Understand resource capacity constraints
- Know target approval rate (40-60%)
- Review automated scoring distribution

**1.3 Set Up Review Environment**
- Block dedicated time for reviews
- Access all proposals in GitHub
- Have evaluation criteria document open
- Prepare feedback templates
- Ready scoring spreadsheet/tool

### Step 2: Individual Proposal Review (Per Submission)

**2.1 Initial Read (3-5 minutes)**
- Read entire proposal without scoring
- Get overall sense of the idea
- Note initial impressions and questions
- Flag anything exceptional or concerning

**2.2 Review Automated Scores (2-3 minutes)**
- Review Level 1 agent's scores and rationales
- Check if scores seem reasonable
- Note any scores that seem off
- Identify areas needing validation

**2.3 Score Team Capability (3-5 minutes)**
Use the [Team Capability Rubric](#team-capability-scoring-rubric) (see below)
- Review team member information
- Assess relevant experience
- Evaluate skill set coverage
- Check role distribution
- Consider commitment indicators
- Assign score (0-10 points)

**2.4 Validate/Adjust Automated Scores (3-5 minutes)**
For each automated criterion, ask:
- **Innovation (25 pts):** Did the agent understand the novelty?
- **Feasibility (20 pts):** Did the agent assess timeline correctly?
- **Business Value (20 pts):** Did the agent grasp the impact?
- **Resources (15 pts):** Did the agent identify all resource needs?
- **Clarity (10 pts):** Did the agent fairly assess completeness?

Make adjustments where automation missed context:
- **Adjust UP:** If agent undervalued human judgment aspects
- **Adjust DOWN:** If agent missed red flags or overscored
- **Document:** Note reason for any adjustment >3 points

**2.5 Calculate Final Score**
- Sum all criteria scores (including Team Capability)
- **Total possible: 100 points**
- Compare to approval threshold (≥60 points)
- Check for any criterion below 6 points (weakness flag)

**2.6 Holistic Assessment (2-3 minutes)**
Beyond the numbers, consider:
- **Gut check:** Does this team have a real shot at success?
- **Mentoring need:** How much support will they require?
- **Strategic fit:** Does this align with organizational priorities?
- **Diversity:** Does approving this add variety to the portfolio?
- **Risk/reward:** Is this a reasonable bet?

**2.7 Document Decision & Feedback (3-5 minutes)**
- Make approval decision
- Write strengths (2-3 specific points)
- Write improvement areas (2-3 constructive suggestions)
- Note any special considerations
- Prepare feedback message

### Step 3: Batch Review & Final Decisions

**3.1 Review All Proposals Holistically**
- Rank all proposals by total score
- Identify natural approval tiers
- Consider resource capacity
- Look for gaps in problem domain coverage
- Check for team/skill diversity

**3.2 Apply Approval Threshold**
**Approve proposals that meet ALL of:**
- ✅ Total score ≥ 60 points
- ✅ No criterion scores < 6 points
- ✅ At least one strength area (criterion scored 17+)
- ✅ No critical blockers identified

**Waitlist proposals that:**
- Score 55-59 points (borderline)
- Have potential but minor concerns
- May fit if capacity increases

**Decline proposals that:**
- Score < 55 points
- Have critical weaknesses (criteria < 6)
- Have blocking resource/feasibility issues
- Don't meet minimum standards

**3.3 Capacity Check**
- Count approved proposals
- Ensure it doesn't exceed mentor capacity
- If too many: Apply tighter criteria (raise threshold to 65)
- If too few: Consider borderline proposals (lower threshold to 57)

**3.4 Final Review**
- Review approval list for balance and fairness
- Check for any obvious outliers or mistakes
- Ensure feedback is complete for all teams
- Prepare summary report

## Validation Guidelines

### When to Adjust Automated Scores

**Adjust Innovation Score UP if:**
- Automation missed domain-specific novelty
- Proposal cleverly combines existing tools in unique way
- Problem-solution fit is more creative than agent recognized
- Industry context makes this more innovative than it appears

**Adjust Innovation Score DOWN if:**
- Proposal is actually a duplicate of existing tool
- "Innovation" is just adding AI to standard process
- Differentiation claims are exaggerated
- Novelty is superficial

**Adjust Feasibility Score UP if:**
- Team has proven track record agent couldn't assess
- Technologies are more accessible than agent knew
- Implementation plan is stronger than agent recognized
- Team has insider knowledge making it more feasible

**Adjust Feasibility Score DOWN if:**
- Agent missed critical technical blockers
- Timeline is even more unrealistic than scored
- Dependencies are harder to meet than agent assessed
- Technical approach has fundamental flaws

**Adjust Business Value Score UP if:**
- Impact is greater than described in proposal
- You have insider knowledge of problem severity
- Scalability potential is higher than agent assessed
- Strategic alignment is stronger than recognized

**Adjust Business Value Score DOWN if:**
- Problem is less severe than described
- User base is smaller than claimed
- Similar solution already exists and is adequate
- Benefits are theoretical rather than practical

**Adjust Resource Score UP if:**
- Requests are more reasonable than agent assessed
- Free alternatives exist that agent didn't know about
- Resources are more accessible than agent knew
- Budget is actually conservative

**Adjust Resource Score DOWN if:**
- Hidden costs not captured in estimate
- Resources are less available than claimed
- Agent missed resource blockers
- Budget is optimistic or incomplete

**Adjust Clarity Score UP if:**
- Proposal is clearer than automated assessment
- Technical jargon made it seem unclear to agent
- Context makes it clearer than it reads
- Agent penalized unnecessarily

**Adjust Clarity Score DOWN if:**
- Proposal is actually less clear than scored
- Important sections are genuinely vague
- Agent was too generous
- Critical details are missing

## Common Evaluation Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Biases

**1. Novelty Bias**
- ❌ "This is so cool and cutting-edge!" → But can they actually build it?
- ✅ Balance innovation with feasibility and impact

**2. Simplicity Bias**
- ❌ "This is too simple, not impressive enough" → But will it help 100 people daily?
- ✅ Value practical impact over complexity

**3. Familiarity Bias**
- ❌ "I understand this domain well, so this must be good" → Is it actually innovative?
- ❌ "I don't understand this domain, so it seems risky" → May be valid in that context
- ✅ Evaluate fairly regardless of your domain expertise

**4. Team Reputation Bias**
- ❌ "I know this person, they're great" → But is THIS proposal solid?
- ❌ "I don't know this team, seems risky" → May be hidden talent
- ✅ Evaluate the proposal and evidence, not your personal knowledge

**5. Perfection Bias**
- ❌ "This has some weaknesses, so it's not good enough" → Everything has weaknesses
- ✅ Look for potential and whether weaknesses are manageable

**6. Risk Aversion Bias**
- ❌ "This seems risky, let's not approve it" → Some risk is acceptable
- ✅ Assess if risks are identified and have mitigation strategies

**7. Recency Bias**
- ❌ "The last few were weak, so I'm being harsh" → Each proposal deserves fresh eyes
- ❌ "I just approved several strong ones, need to be pickier now" → Maintain consistent standards
- ✅ Take breaks between batches to reset perspective

### ✅ Best Practices

**1. Read Holistically First**
- Understand the full proposal before scoring
- Let the idea sink in before judging
- Consider context and constraints

**2. Score Independently**
- Evaluate each criterion on its own merits
- Don't let one score influence others
- Use the rubric, not gut feeling alone

**3. Think Long-Term**
- Could this become a permanent tool?
- Will this team grow from the experience?
- Does this build organizational capability?

**4. Be Constructive**
- Even declined proposals deserve helpful feedback
- Identify specific improvement areas
- Encourage future participation

**5. Stay Calibrated**
- Compare notes with co-mentor regularly
- Discuss borderline cases
- Maintain scoring consistency

**6. Consider Portfolio Balance**
- Mix of innovative and practical projects
- Variety of problem domains
- Range of team experience levels (mostly strong, some developing)

## Special Situations

### Borderline Proposals (Score 55-59)
**Decision Framework:**
- ✅ **Approve if:** Team is strong (8+) and just one weakness area
- 🔍 **Waitlist if:** Generally solid but resource constrained
- ❌ **Decline if:** Multiple moderate weaknesses with weak team

**Questions to Ask:**
- Could mentoring overcome the weaknesses?
- Is there untapped potential not captured in scores?
- Would approval add valuable diversity to approved portfolio?
- Do we have capacity to support a higher-need team?

### Highly Innovative but Risky Proposals
**Decision Framework:**
- ✅ **Approve if:** Team is very strong, risks are identified and mitigated
- 🔍 **Waitlist if:** Need to see what other options exist first
- ❌ **Decline if:** Team is not capable of managing the risk

**Philosophy:** Some high-risk, high-reward projects can be worthwhile IF the team is exceptional. Aim for 10-20% of approved projects to be in this category.

### Practical but Uninspiring Proposals
**Decision Framework:**
- ✅ **Approve if:** High business value, clear impact, solid team
- ✅ **Approve if:** Fills important gap in problem domain coverage
- ❌ **Decline if:** Innovation score < 10 and no exceptional impact

**Philosophy:** "Boring but useful" can be valuable, especially if it demonstrates real ROI and could become a permanent tool.

### Solo Teams
**Decision Framework:**
- ⚠️ **Caution:** Solo participants have higher failure rate
- ✅ **Approve if:** Scope is small, individual is highly capable, proposal is strong
- 🔍 **Suggest:** Encourage finding team members before approval
- ❌ **Decline if:** Scope is ambitious or individual lacks track record

### Duplicate/Similar Proposals
**Decision Framework:**
- ✅ **Both approved:** If approaches are genuinely different
- ✅ **One approved:** Select stronger team or approach
- 🔍 **Suggest team merger:** If teams are willing and compatible
- ❌ **Both declined:** If neither is strong enough on its own

### Resource-Intensive Proposals
**Decision Framework:**
- ✅ **Approve if:** Impact justifies cost and proposal is otherwise strong
- 🔍 **Negotiate:** Can costs be reduced or free alternatives found?
- ❌ **Decline if:** Resources unavailable or costs unjustified

## FAQs for Mentors

**Q: What if I disagree significantly with automated scores?**
A: You have full authority to adjust scores. Document your reasoning for adjustments >3 points. The automated scores are guidance, not requirements.

**Q: Can I approve a proposal that scores below 60?**
A: Yes, if you believe there are exceptional circumstances or untapped potential. Document your reasoning thoroughly.

**Q: What if two proposals are nearly identical?**
A: Consider suggesting a team merger if compatible. Otherwise, approve the stronger team/approach or both if genuinely different.

**Q: How much weight should Team Capability have?**
A: Significant weight. Even a great idea will fail without a capable team. Strong teams (8-10 points) can overcome moderate weaknesses in other areas.

**Q: What if I'm unsure about technical feasibility?**
A: Consult with your co-mentor or a technical expert. Don't approve if you have serious feasibility doubts.

**Q: Should I be lenient or strict?**
A: Be fair and consistent. Use the rubrics objectively. Remember that approval means committing resources, so maintain standards.

**Q: How do I handle borderline cases?**
A: Use the holistic assessment factors: team strength, mentoring need, strategic fit, diversity. When in doubt, discuss with co-mentor.

**Q: What if we don't have enough strong proposals?**
A: Don't lower standards just to hit approval targets. It's better to approve fewer strong proposals than many weak ones.
