# Stage 5: Midway Check-in Evaluation Criteria

## Overview
The midway check-in (Week 5) is a support checkpoint to assess team progress, identify risks, and provide guidance for the final week. This is NOT a gate or elimination round - it's a mentoring and support opportunity.

## Purpose
- **Track Progress:** Understand how teams are advancing toward their goals
- **Identify Risks:** Catch potential failures early and intervene
- **Provide Support:** Offer technical guidance, resource help, or scope advice
- **Adjust Expectations:** Help teams recalibrate if needed for realistic final deliverables
- **Maintain Morale:** Encourage teams and recognize progress

---

## Evaluation Philosophy

### This is NOT:
- ❌ A pass/fail gate
- ❌ A scoring competition
- ❌ An elimination round
- ❌ A judgment of team capability
- ❌ A quality assessment of final work

### This IS:
- ✅ A progress checkpoint
- ✅ A risk identification exercise
- ✅ A support and guidance opportunity
- ✅ A reality check on timeline and scope
- ✅ A morale booster and encouragement moment

## Mentor Guidelines

### Conducting Midway Reviews

**Preparation:**
1. Review the team's original proposal
2. Read their midway submission thoroughly
3. Note specific questions or concerns
4. Prepare constructive feedback
5. Have solution ideas ready for their challenges

**Review Call Structure (if needed):**
1. **Check-in** (5 min): How's the team feeling?
2. **Progress review** (10 min): Demo current state, discuss accomplishments
3. **Challenge discussion** (10 min): What's blocking them?
4. **Guidance** (10 min): Provide specific advice and solutions
5. **Action items** (5 min): Clear next steps and priorities
6. **Encouragement** (5 min): Boost morale, remind them of their strengths

**Key Principles:**
- Be supportive, not judgmental
- Focus on solutions, not problems
- Help them succeed with realistic scope
- Better to have a small complete demo than large incomplete one
- Encourage learning regardless of outcome
- Prevent burnout and maintain morale

## Common Midway Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "We're behind because we changed our idea"
**Response:** That happens! Let's make sure the new direction is achievable. Show me what you have now and let's scope it appropriately.

### Scenario 2: "The AI isn't working as expected"
**Response:** Let's debug together. Show me what's happening. We may need to adjust parameters, try different prompts, or use a different model.

### Scenario 3: "We can't get access to [resource]"
**Response:** Let me escalate this immediately. In the meantime, let's identify a workaround or alternative.

### Scenario 4: "A team member dropped out"
**Response:** That's tough. Let's adjust scope to match your current capacity. What can the remaining members realistically complete?

### Scenario 5: "We're actually done and want to add more"
**Response:** That's great! Let's make sure what you have is polished and documented first. Then, we can discuss stretch goals.

### Scenario 6: "This is taking way longer than we thought"
**Response:** Welcome to software development! Let's prioritize ruthlessly. What's the #1 thing you must demo? Everything else is optional.

### Scenario 7: "We're so far behind, should we just give up?"
**Response:** Absolutely not! Let's define a minimal demo that's achievable. Even a small working demo is valuable and you'll learn a ton.

### Scenario 8: "Everything is working perfectly"
**Response:** Fantastic! Let me see a demo to confirm. Then let's ensure you have time for polish, documentation, and a great demo video.
