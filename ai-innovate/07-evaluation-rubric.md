# CONFLICT OF INTEREST

## 🚫 Conflict of Interest Policy

### What Constitutes a Conflict?

**Direct Conflicts:**
- ❌ Judge is team member or mentor of a team
- ❌ Judge manages participants directly
- ❌ Judge has financial interest in outcome
- ❌ Judge significantly contributed to solution

**Indirect Conflicts:**
- ⚠️ Judge works closely with team members
- ⚠️ Judge suggested the problem or approach
- ⚠️ Judge has personal relationship with participants
- ⚠️ Judge's team/department could benefit disproportionately

### Disclosure Requirements

**All judges must:**
1. Complete conflict of interest form
2. Disclose any potential conflicts
3. Identify teams they should recuse from
4. Update if new conflicts arise

### Recusal Process

**If conflict exists:**
1. Judge discloses conflict to program chair
2. Judge recuses from scoring that specific team
3. Judge does not participate in deliberations about that team
4. Judge's other scores remain valid

**Score adjustment:**
- If judge recuses, remaining judges' scores are used
- Minimum 5 judges required per team
- If <5 judges, replacement judge scores the team

# JUDGING BEST PRACTICES

## ✅ Do's for Judges

### Before Judging
✅ **Review the full rubric thoroughly**
- Understand each criterion deeply
- Note scoring guidelines
- Calibrate your standards

✅ **Block dedicated time**
- Each submission needs 30-45 min review
- Schedule uninterrupted time
- Plan multiple sessions if needed

✅ **Prepare your environment**
- Good audio equipment for videos
- Large screen for demos
- Note-taking tools ready

### During Judging
✅ **Be consistent**
- Use same standards for all teams
- Score based on rubric, not personal preference
- Avoid score inflation or deflation

✅ **Take detailed notes**
- Document rationale for scores
- Note strengths and weaknesses
- Capture specific examples

✅ **Focus on what's presented**
- Judge what's submitted, not potential
- Don't assume missing information
- Don't fill in gaps yourself

✅ **Be objective**
- Set aside personal biases
- Focus on criteria, not personalities
- Judge work, not effort

### After Individual Scoring
✅ **Review your scores**
- Check for consistency across teams
- Ensure full score range used
- Verify rationale is documented

✅ **Participate in calibration**
- Share perspectives openly
- Be willing to adjust scores
- Focus on fairness

---

## ❌ Don'ts for Judges

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't score based on potential**
- Judge what's demonstrated, not what could be
- "This could be great if..." is not sufficient

❌ **Don't let presentation override substance**
- Slick presentation doesn't equal quality solution
- Poor presentation shouldn't hide good technical work
- Balance presentation and substance scores

❌ **Don't compare to your ideal solution**
- Judge against rubric, not your mental design
- Teams have time and resource constraints
- Focus on what they achieved

❌ **Don't score on effort alone**
- Effort is admirable but not the criterion
- Judge outcomes and quality, not just input

❌ **Don't score too high or too low across the board**
- Use the full range of scores (0-100)
- Differentiate between teams
- Avoid score compression

❌ **Don't let first impressions dominate**
- Review all materials before finalizing scores
- Technical docs might reveal quality not in demo
- Give each section due weight

❌ **Don't discuss teams outside official sessions**
- Avoid hallway conversations about specific teams
- Keep deliberations confidential
- Maintain integrity of process

## 🎯 Calibration Tips

### Establishing Baselines

**1. Score 3-5 teams first**
- Get a feel for the range of quality
- Establish your internal baseline
- Note high/medium/low examples

**2. Adjust if needed**
- If all scores are in narrow range, recalibrate
- Use more of the scale
- Differentiate more clearly

**3. Compare with other judges**
- During calibration, see how others scored
- Understand different perspectives
- Adjust your approach if way off

### Maintaining Consistency

**Use reference teams:**
- Pick a "good" example (score ~70)
- Use as reference point for others
- "Is this better or worse than Team X?"

**Check your patterns:**
- Are you scoring all Innovation high but Technical low?
- Are scores clustered too tightly?
- Are you using the full rubric range?

# APPENDIX

## 📊 Score Distribution Guidelines

### Healthy Score Distribution

For a well-calibrated judging process, expect:
- **90-100:** Top 5-10% (exceptional)
- **80-89:** Next 15-20% (excellent)
- **70-79:** Next 30-40% (good)
- **60-69:** Next 20-30% (average)
- **Below 60:** Bottom 10-15% (needs improvement)

### Red Flags

**If all scores are 80+:**
- Too lenient, not differentiating
- Need to recalibrate standards

**If all scores are below 70:**
- Too harsh, missing excellence
- Need to adjust expectations

**If scores are tightly clustered:**
- Not using full rubric range
- Need to differentiate more
