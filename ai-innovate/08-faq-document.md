> "Use the mentors! Ours helped us refocus when we were building too much. Also, quantify everything - savings, time, money, errors reduced."

> "Make your demo relatable. Show a real person's problem and how your solution helps them. People vote for things they can understand and connect with."

**From 2024 Best Innovation Winner:**
